#summary Where did all of this stuff come from?

= Introduction =

Everything has to start somewhere, and here I will try to show my gratitude to those who have helped me along this path.


= Details =

Chuck Moore made colorForth, which runs Okad, which he uses to design his chips.

Les Snively hired me to help him develop software defined radios with Chuck's chips.

John Rible got me started on the colorForth -> ASCII -> colorForth translator (cf2a2cf) when I 1st joined IntellaSys

Albert van der Horst created the computer intelligence assembler disassembler (ciasdis).

John Comeau used ciasdis to decipher the arrayForth kernel with most of the initial labels.

I will add more as they become known to me.

I greatly appreciate everyone's help and encouragement!
